# node-hoptoad-notifier

Report exceptions to Hoptoad from node.js.

## Example

    var
    Hoptoad = require('./lib/hoptoad-notifier').Hoptoad;
    Hoptoad.key = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

    process.addListener('uncaughtException', function(error) {
      Hoptoad.notify(error);

      // Optionally provide a callback.
      Hoptoad.notify(error, function(err) {
        if (err) {
          throw err;
        } else {
          console.log('Error sent to Hoptoad.');
        }
      });
    });

## Configuration

### API Key (required)

You can set your project API key with the `HOPTOAD_API_KEY` environment
variable or dynamically with:

    Hoptoad.key = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

### Environment (optional)

The environment defaults to `production`. You can overwrite it by setting a
`RACK_ENV` or `NODE_ENV` environment variable. Additionally you can overwrite
it dynamically with:

    Hoptoad.environment = 'staging';

### Custom Backtrace Filters

Lines in the backtrace containing `hoptoad-notifier.js` are filtered by
default. You can add custom filters by pushing regular expressions on the
`backtrace_filters` variable:

    Hoptoad.backtrace_filters.push(/filter this line/);
